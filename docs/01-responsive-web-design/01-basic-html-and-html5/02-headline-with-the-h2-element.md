# Headline with the h2 Element
## Summary
- Heading levels can be adjusted by changing the number in `<h1>` and `</h1>`.
- This helps tell the browser about the structure of the website.
- Heading levels vary from `<h1>` to `<h6>`.
- `h1` are used for main headings while `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, and `h6` headings are used for subheadings.
    - You should only use an `h1` heading once on any given webpage.

## Final Code

{% highlight HTML %}
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
{% endhighlight %}
