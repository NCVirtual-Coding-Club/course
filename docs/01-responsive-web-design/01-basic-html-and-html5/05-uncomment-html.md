# Uncomment HTML
## Summary
- Commenting is a way that you can leave comments for other developers within your code without affecting the resulting output that is displayed to the end user.
- Commenting can also be useful to make a section of code inactive, without deleting it.
- Comments in HTML start with `<!--` and end with `-->`

## Final Code

{% highlight HTML %}
<h1>Hello World</h1>

<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere...</p>
{% endhighlight %}
