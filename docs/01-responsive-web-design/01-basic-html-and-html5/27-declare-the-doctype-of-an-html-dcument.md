# Declare the Doctype of an HTML Document
## Summary
- It is important to include `<!DOCTYPE html>` at the start of an HTML document.
- The rest of your HTML code needs to be wrapped in `html` tags. The opening `<html>` goes directly below the `<!DOCTYPE html>` line, and the closing `</html>` goes at the end of the page.

## Final Code

{% highlight HTML %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <h1></h1>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}
